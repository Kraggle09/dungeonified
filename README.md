# Dungeonified

## About the Project
Dungeonified originally started as [a resource pack](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/dungeonified/) that added Minecraft dungeons textures. It eventually evolved to include some item textures, and had block textures planned. 
However, I grew tired of the limitations of resource packs. For example, to add mob variants I was using the Optifine format. Which is fine for some variants (i.e. pillager visual differences) 
but not great for others (like the Fungus thrower Piglin, which is only accessible by naming a Piglin). So I decided to make a mod version of Dungeonified, which will allow much more features, 
and better support of existing ones.

## Current features of the mod
- Directly matching textures of vanilla mobs (zombie, skeleton, etc)
- 18 blocks, plus slab and stair variants

## FAQ
**What will happen to the resource pack?**  
I plan to slim it down a lot; Remove all variants that don't make sense (Iceologer, Fungus Thrower Piglin, etc), leaving any variants that do make sense. 
I won't be adding blocks to it, and I might remove items, not sure yet. I will probably still update the pack to work on newer versions of the game, but that's it.

**What version of Minecraft is this for?**  
Java Edition 1.21.1

**Where can I download this mod?**
